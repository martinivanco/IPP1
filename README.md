# Syntax highlighting
First project made as a part of the course Principles of Programming Languages at Brno University of Technology. The task was to create a PHP 5 script that searches for regular expressions in text and highlights them using html markup tags.

### Files:

* syn.php - script
* SYN-doc.pdf - implementation specific documentation
* sample_in.c - sample input file
* sample_format.txt - sample format file
* sample_out.html - sample output file - this file was created by the script by running the following: php syn.php --input=sample_in.c --format=sample_format.txt --output=sample_out.html --br
